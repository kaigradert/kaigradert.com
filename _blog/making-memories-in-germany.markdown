We finally made it to Germany. This trip was long overdue. Traveling with a 16-months-old is exhausting, but seeing my Mom meet Aadi for the first time was all worth it.

We spent two weeks in the countryside where I grew up, just outside of Hamburg in Northern Germany. We hoped for snow, but instead we got mild winter days. The days went by fast. We slept a lot, spent time with my Mom, visited the Christmas market, cut our own Christmas tree and explored the countryside.

Life is about making memories.

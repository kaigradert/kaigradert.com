<p>Thursday evening I stopped by at the Pasadena Art Center to get a first look at this term’s Graduation Show.</p>

<p>The graduation show features remarkable student accomplishments from a variety of fields in Advertising, Film, Product &amp; Transportation Design to Illustration, Photography, and Imaging among others.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Play is the highest form of research.&lt;footer&gt; - Albert Einstein&lt;/footer&gt;</p>

<p>The featured work was serious yet playful, tackling real problems in a thoughtful manner. A common theme among all the work was an almost childlike naiveté and playfulness. And I mean that in the most respectful way.</p>

<p>It was inspiring to talk with the students and have them walk me through their design process. Being able to articulate your designs is an essential part of being a designer.</p>

<p>Everybody I spoke with had a clear vision and objective of what they were trying to accomplish in their work. No matter if this was for a clay model in transportation design or a simple poster in graphic design.</p>

<p>There was a sense that anything is possible among the graduates. This type of culture and perspective is what gives design centered teams a leading edge in today’s design-centric world.</p>

<p>If I could give only one piece of advice to any graduating designer, it would be: <em>“Please never lose your childlike curiosity and naiveté when designing.”</em> Anything is possible if you approach it with an open mind. You are only limited by your determination and imagination. Don’t let the feature matrix define your creative horizon.</p>

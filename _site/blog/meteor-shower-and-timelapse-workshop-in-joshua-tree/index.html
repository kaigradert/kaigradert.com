<p>With photography, as with most everything else in life, half of the battle is being in the right place at the right time.</p>

<p>So when I found out about a timelapse workshop in Joshua Tree with <a href="http://www.evosiastudios.com/about/">Henry Jun Wah Lee</a>, I signed up at the very last minute to make an effort to get out into nature, learn new techniques and to have some new experiences.</p>

<p>Check out Henry’s amazing work on <a href="http://vimeo.com/evosia">Vimeo</a>.</p>

<p>I have never done any serious time-lapse photography before, but I have no doubt that I will have an incredible few days in Joshua Tree during a meteor shower.</p>

<p>According to NASA, the upcoming Perseid meteor shower produces more fireballs — bright meteors that streak across the sky — than any other annual shower, earning it the title of <em>“fireball champion”</em>.</p>

<p>If I come home with one great shot, it will be all worth it. Stay tuned for photos from the weekend :)</p>

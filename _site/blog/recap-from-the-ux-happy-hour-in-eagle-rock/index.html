<p>We just wrapped up another UX Happy Hour in Los Angeles and the turnout was fantastic.</p>

<p>Here are a few notes and selected photos from last nights <a href="http://www.uxhappyhour.com/la">UX Happy Hour</a> in Eagle Rock. You can also view the entire set on <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/kaigradert/sets/72157662567935440">Flickr</a>.</p>

<p>Overall this might have been the largest UX Happy Hour in Los Angeles to date. We had almost 100 people who RSVPâ€™ed and we had about 60-70 people who showed up. Lots of new and familiar faces. Very happy to see this type of response.</p>

<p><a href="https://twitter.com/JonFoxUX">Jon Fox</a> setup out his new <a href="https://www.leapmotion.com/">Leap Motion</a> and I brought my <a href="http://www.google.com/glass/start/">Google Glass</a> Explorer edition which lead to lots of engaging UX conversations, product demos, and laughs.</p>

<p>Thanks to Jon and Petra Cesario from <a href="http://www.meetup.com/NELAUX/">NELAUX</a> for co-hosting this event. This is the second time that we have teamed up with NELAUX to bring the UX Happy Hour to the East Side of Los Angeles.</p>

<p>If you are looking for a great Meetup venue on the East Side of Los Angeles, I can highly recommend <a href="http://www.yelp.com/biz/verdugo-los-angeles">Verdugo Bar</a> in Eagle Rock. It has a large outdoor patio, awesome staff and a wide variety of drinks. And they also have a pop culture trivia event on Tuesday that starts at 8 pm :)</p>

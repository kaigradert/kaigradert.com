Sometimes we need a little boost. A simple reminder to “look on the bright side” or “stop and smell the roses”. Sometimes we get so caught up in the daily grind that we forget to be grateful for the little (and not-so-little) things in life.

We recently released an update to our <a href="http://www.chee.rs/" title="Cheers App: Cheers to what you love!">Cheers app</a> and I thought I take a moment to talk about the purpose of the app.

If you are not familiar with Cheers yet. It's a simple iPhone app way to bring gratitude, mindfulness and joy into your life. Cheers helps you start and end your day with positive images, quotes and a community of positive people. It’s a great way to lift your mood.

So why Cheers? Positive emotions are associated with greater creativity, increased problem-solving ability, and greater overall success in life.

> “… you are paving the road to a better community with this app. It totally fulfills a need to celebrate the good around us in a public way, which in turn sets off a chain reaction for others to celebrate the good around them too!” — <a href="http://www.chee.rs/company/cheerful-reactions">Lizza M.</a>

Gratitude and positivity have been <a href="http://www.spring.org.uk/2008/12/better-mood-from-gratitude-2-minute.php" title="Better Mood from Gratitude: 2 Minute Exercise – Start Now!">shown</a> to boost creativity and success as well as increase overall <a href="http://www.spring.org.uk/2007/09/practicing-gratitude-can-increase.php">happiness</a>, and Cheers is a great way to get your positivity fix anywhere — at home, abroad — wherever you can carry your phone!

But why should you Cheer instead of shouting out on Facebook or Twitter? Pretty simple, <a href="http://info.uwe.ac.uk/news/uwenews/news.aspx?id=2311" title="Study: Adolescent girls who over use internet and social media suffer lower self-esteem and negative body image">studies</a> show a correlation between Facebook usage and depression as well as low <a href="http://www.livescience.com/18324-facebook-depression-social-comparison.html">self-esteem</a>.

Facebook is not set up as a pay-it-forward, positive environment. As for Twitter, the charity Anxiety UK recently conducted a <a href="http://www.mediabistro.com/alltwitter/twitter-anxiety-study_b25123">poll</a> that showed anxiety spikes for Twitter users as well, accompanied with lowered self-confidence.

Cheers, on the other hand, is a risk-free positive forum devoted to… well, cheering! Cheering on a friend, colleague or the waitress at the local diner who made your day by giving you an extra roll.

Cheering a random piece of art, an admirable event or a yummy treat. Cheering for the sake of cheering; in the interests of gratitude; for the sake of reveling in all the marvels, big and small, this incredible world has to offer.

**Cheer for Today:** If you don’t have the Cheers app yet, <a title="Get the Free Cheers iPhone App" href="http://www.chee.rs/" target="_blank">get it</a>! If you do have it, stop what you’re doing and cheer!

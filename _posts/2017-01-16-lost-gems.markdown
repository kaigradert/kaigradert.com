    title: Sunrise on the Rocks
    caption: Beautiful soft light breaking through a large block of ice, producing
      soft diffused shadows on the black-sand beach. I captured this image on a trip
      to Iceland in 2015.

    title: Salt Formations
    caption: A long exposure of salt formations in the Dead Sea. I was only there
      for one morning with little preparation. The long exposure and humid air blurred
      out the background. There is some charm to the blurry background, but I believe
      the image would be stronger with the mountains in focus. I wish had taken another
      short exposure of just the background.

    title: Icelandic Horse
    caption: When you look them in the eye, you can sense a thoughtfulness and calm
      that you don't get with a lot of other creatures.

A common problem of working with a digital camera is the number of images you generate over time.

The goal of this project is to reduce the size of my photo catalog and hopefully rediscover a few forgotten gems. I will go through the catalog on a regular basis and publish one image from the archive per week. It will be a mixed bag of photos. Enjoy!

    title: Salt Formations
    caption: A long exposure of salt formations in the Dead Sea. I was only there
      for one morning with little preparation. The long exposure and humid air blurred
      out the background. There is some charm to the blurry background, but I believe
      the image would be stronger with the mountains in focus. I wish had taken another
      short exposure of just the background.

    title: Sunrise on the Rocks
    caption: Beautiful soft light breaking through a large block of ice, producing
      soft diffused shadows on the black-sand beach. I captured this image on a trip
      to Iceland in 2015.

A common problem of working with a digital camera is the sheer amount of images you generate over time.

The goal of this project is to reduce the size of my photo catalog and hopefully rediscover 52 forgotten gems. I will go through the catalog on a regular basis and publish one image from the archive per week. It will be a mixed bag of photos. Enjoy!

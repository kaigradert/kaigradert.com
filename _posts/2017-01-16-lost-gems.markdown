  title: Sunrise on the Rocks
---

A common problem of working with a digital camera is the sheer amount of images you generate over time.

The goal of this project is to reduce the size of my photo catalog and hopefully rediscover 52 forgotten gems. I will go through the catalog on a regular basis and publish one image from the archive per week. It will be a mixed bag of photos. Enjoy!

2014 has been a transformational year. The birth of our son, relocation to a new city, closure of one startup adventure, the beginning of another startup journey and the launch of various big design projects.

To manifest the transition I have composed a short film of sequences that were shot primarily during the same period. This movie represents the transformation of a single day.

The sequences were captured on multiple occasions in Joshua Tree. Original music by [Phil Clevenger](http://blog.pamandphil.com/category/phils-photos/). Enjoy!

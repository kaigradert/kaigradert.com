With photography, as with most everything else in life, half of the battle is being in the right place at the right time.

So when I found out about a timelapse workshop in Joshua Tree with <a href="http://www.evosiastudios.com/about/">Henry Jun Wah Lee</a>, I signed up at the very last minute to make an effort to get out into nature, learn new techniques and to have some new experiences.

Check out Henry's amazing work on <a href="http://vimeo.com/evosia">Vimeo</a>.

I have never done any serious time-lapse photography before, but I have no doubt that I will have an incredible few days in Joshua Tree during a meteor shower.

According to NASA, the upcoming Perseid meteor shower produces more fireballs — bright meteors that streak across the sky — than any other annual shower, earning it the title of *“fireball champion”*.

If I come home with one great shot, it will be all worth it. Stay tuned for photos from the weekend :)
